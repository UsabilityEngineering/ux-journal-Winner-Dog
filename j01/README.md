# Aerials in Rocket League

Rocket League is considered to be the most mechanical game on the market. It's a vehicular soccer video game where players control cars equipped with rockets to hit a giant soccer ball and score goals in an arena-style environment. Mechanics refer to the specific skills, techniques, and in-game actions players use to control their cars and interact with the game environment. There is a wide range of mechanics, from easy-to-learn which allows newcomers to play, to advanced which allows experienced players to remain engaged by ensuring a highly competitive experience. I will be discussing the most crucial advanced mechanic needed for competitive gameplay, the Aerial.

An aerial is when your car is essentially "flying" in the air. Remember that these vehicles are equipped with a rocket on the back, allowing them to perform that action. To make things as simple as possible, the first thing I will discuss is how to "hit the ball in the air." 

You first want to enter a game mode that allows you to move your car. I recommend the Tutorial for aerials since it's literally a place for a player to practice the mechanic.

Once you're in-game, you want to position your car in front and under the ball. On KBM (Keyboard and Mouse), you can move your car using the "WASD" keys.

Next, you want to hit the jump button. On KBM, the default button would be the right-click button on the mouse.

You would then lean backward in the air so that the front of your car is pointing up. On KBM, this would be the 'S' key.

Lastly, you want to hit the boost button which will allow your car to hit the ball into the goal. On KBM, the default button is left-click on the mouse.

If a text saying "aerial" popped up then this means you have successfully done an aerial. If not, you either did not or you have the option where extra information pops up. To enable it, go to "Settings", then Â¨Interface, and make sure the Match notifications option is "All."

Congratulations, you have now performed an aerial. Now, you might be thinking, "That wasn't so hard," but you need to realize that the ball was not moving, the ball was already in the air, and there are no other cars/players interacting with you or the ball. If you include all those factors, especially the skill level of the player, performing an aerial becomes a lot harder. And I want to mention, that was just the beginning. There are many types of aerials, such as air dribbling (which is dribbling the ball in the air) and flip-resets (which is resetting your second jump by using the ball as a flat surface). These mechanics are very advanced, where only someone with a mastery in the basic aerial can achieve these feats.
